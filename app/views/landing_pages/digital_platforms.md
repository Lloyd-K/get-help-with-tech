# Get funding and support to set up a digital education platform

## About this programme

Government-funded support is available for schools to get set up and access one of two free-to-use digital education platforms. You can choose to use either:

- G Suite for Education (Google Classroom)
- Office 365 Education (Microsoft Teams)

[The Key for School Leaders website](https://covid19.thekeysupport.com/covid-19/deliver-remote-learning/make-tech-work-you/feature-comparison-g-suite-education-and-office-365-education/) provides feature comparison and case studies on how schools are making the most of these platforms, to help you make the most appropriate choice for your school.

You have until the end of March 2021 to register with this programme and claim your grant.

### What is a digital education platform?

It's a place where teachers and pupils can continue learning through online virtual classrooms. 

The platforms are purpose-built for remote learning in a way that a school website is not. Teachers can:

- communicate with pupils via video calls
- set tasks
- let pupils work together through supervised group calls
- give personalised feedback

Using a digital education platform will allow teachers and pupils to continue education if a school closes.

[The Key for School Leaders website](https://covid19.thekeysupport.com/covid-19/deliver-remote-learning/lead-your-approach/why-every-school-should-be-using-digital-education-platform/) has information on why you should make the move to a digital education platform, if you have not already. 

## Who can apply

Support is available to state funded:

- primary schools
- secondary schools
- special schools
- pupil referral units

Virtual schools are also eligible for the programme. Particularly schools that regularly coordinate and deliver elements of the educational provision, and engage with looked after children. 

Trusts and sponsors are eligible to apply on behalf of their schools.

The funded support is for schools that:

- do not have a digital education platform
- have access to Office 365 Education or G Suite for Education, but are not set up to assign work and communicate with pupils
